No i am going to do the zap from scratch. I need only these data to be used in the data variable from supabase: Order Id, Batch Id(If ordered from checkout with batch), Order Details(Product, Variant, Quantity, Unit Price, Subtotal) Make sure it handles both single product buy from buynow and batch buying from checkout, Shop Name, Shop Address, Order date(dd/mm/yyyy). Make it a simple approach and data calling from supabase to zappier
